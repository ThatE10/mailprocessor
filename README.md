# Unique Email Identification and Spam detection
The goal of this project was to build a system to process all my 46k emails and find all the senders.  Using this sender list I will help clean up my internet presences to ensure a clean digital footprint.  This also follows the use of a password manager to help ensure passwords are unique and stored securely.

## Features
- Email extraction via IMAP and POP internet protocols
- Web UI to showoff statistics about senders and total # of spam
- Spam detector using microsoft/deberta-v3-base
